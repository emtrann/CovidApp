In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the BCG vaccine may be effective against leprosy and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as buruli ulcer disease. Other papers have posited the vaccine is effective in preventing acute respiratory tract infections in elderly patients, other respiratory infection and sepsis. A recent non-peer reviewed paper in the preprint server medRxiv has suggested countries with BCG vaccination programs at childhood are faring better in the fight against COVID-19 compared with countries that do not require BCG vaccination."
