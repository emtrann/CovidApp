# Covid-Lite Tracer

The Covid-Lite Tracer is a web-app resource for all things related to Covid-19 built using React, Express, & PostgreSQL (ElephantSQL). It allows the user to see general trends for Canada and individual provinces & territories on the dashboard. The Assesement page provides a list of information resources for Covid self-assessments and province restrictions and guidelines. The user can see recent Covid-19 news on the news page, and click on the "Vaccine Progress" tab to see progress bars on vaccines currently being developed. Upon login, the user can set a 2-week self-isolation timer, and place a location marker on the map by self-reporting. The map displays current health region cases as well as self-report markers. The heat map displays Covid-19 hotspots within the last two weeks.
